# bamazon
## A simple marketplace for buying products

Getting started:
*first create your database using the schema.sql file
*second seed it with initial data using seed.sql
*lastly you will need to create a secureInfo.js file
'var password = "Put your own mySQL password here";
exports.password = password;'
**Now you are ready to rock!**

Purchasing can be accessed both through console - simply follow the prompts after starting bamazonCustomer.js

But if you are a power user you can access the same actions through the API.  Just use the below postman collection:
bamazon.postman_collection.json

Happy shopping!
